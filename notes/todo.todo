Todo:
    â–¡ would some refactors and helper functions make working with shared.players easier
      maybe tied into rolekeeper.
      instead of using me.role_keeper.role maybe RoleKeeper.myRole()
      instead of shared.players[me.role_keeper.role] ??
      instead of for (player of Object.values(shared.players)) ??
